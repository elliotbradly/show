In the World to come there is little imperfection. 
There are just lots of American Alligators. 

After the election of the first androgynous President, the Prediatrain movement caught fire in America.

The demand for American Alligator meat skyrocketed.
Warhols where burned to ash while Polled Hereford Heifors fetched over a million kardanos a head in auction.
Googizon won the bid to construct for the military the most forward thinking alligator farm in existence
It currently floats near the Okeenokee Snow Swamp.

This is not that story.
We are Primal Ponds Inc.
A small mom and pop alligator farm attempting to make it.
We need you to make deliveries for us.
Please...

And one more thing...

It turns out no one has made a crappy real time virtual reality game dedicated to alligator tail in the far, far, future. 
Maybe that needs to change

We proudly introduce today
All American Alligator Delivery System. 

The Alligator Farm where the gator products are delivered is currently under a series of construction tasks. Already we own over four over ten foot alligators including Rex Lex, a massive 14 foot beast. Each on is incredibly detailed with over twenty biological parts. We are currently broadcasting their vital signs over at americanalligator.xyz 

Our alligators come in many different sizes, ages, shapes, sexes and shades. The like to eat, sleep, dream, and spawn but they love to fight and gossip. The algorithms which run each alligator is closely modeled after the habits of the real world reptile, Alligator Missippissus. Their lungs breath and their hearts beat just like yours.

Orders for gator teeth are starting to accumulate. We just need your help to fund creation of the wrestling simulation. Our desire is to create an experiences which leaves you dripping from the feeling of utter terror and awe as you combat one of these unpredictable beasts. 

Alligator Delivery Service in addition to gator tail, we serve realism. Hours of alligator combat video have been studied. Real life wild life wranglers have been interviewed. Now we just need to create a budget towards the creation of an accurate Alligator Wrestling Simulation.

And on behalf of all the artists improving this system.
Thank you for allowing us to serve your Alligator Fantasies
